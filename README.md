# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Welcome To My Portfolio!

Hi! I Am Rithul Kamesh. A Student-Developer based in India!

I'm 16, and in 12th grade. Been snooping around code since I was 8, and have messed with a ton of languages and frameworks. I have fallen in love with rust and building a lot of stuff with it. Stay tuned for info!

This repo is for my [website](https://rithul.dev) and the source code is open, because why not!
