# üëã Hello! Welcome To My Portfolio!

Hi! I Am Rithul Kamesh. A Student-Developer based in India!

I am a 15 year-old 11th grader. Currently Studying in BGS National Public School, I discovered and fell in love with Node.js around the early 2020s. My future interests are in Aeronautical Engineering and Aritficial Intelligence. I ‚ù§Ô∏è open source and create open source projects a lot too.

This repo is for my [website](https://rithul.dev) and the source code is open, because why not!
